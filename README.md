# LibNeuralAI

a library for making flat neural networks and convolutional neural networks in C++

the library contains two example programs to showcase how the neural networks may be constructed

"train_AI_sum_three_numbers.cpp" makes a new flat neural network and trains it to predict the sign of the sum of three numbers that it takes as an input (which are between -100 and 100)

"train_AI_MNIST.cpp" assumes that you have the training and testing labels and images datasets from the MNIST handwritten digits database, each in its own file, in the same directory as the project
making a new convolutional neural network and training it to recognize the handwritten digits, and saving the neural network in a new file titled "brain.cnn"
